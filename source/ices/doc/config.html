   <table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#007B79" height="10" align="center"></td></tr></table>
   <p>The ices 2 configuration file is in XML format, which is described in detail below.
   There are some sample XML files provided in the distribution under the conf directory
   which show the main way ices is used.<p>
   </p>
   live audio streaming, takes audio from the soundcard which can be captured from say the
   Mic, line-In, CD or a combination of these. 
   <ul>
       <li>ices-oss.xml</li>
       <li>ices-alsa.xml</li>
       <li>ices-roar.xml</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Playlist audio streaming, takes pre-encoded Ogg Vorbis files and either sends them
   as-is or re-encodes them to different settings</p>
   <ul>

   </ul>
   <h2>General layout</h2>
   <pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
    &lt;ices&gt;
        general settings
        stream section
    &lt;/ices&gt;
   </pre>
   <h2>General settings</h2>
   <p>These apply to IceS as a whole. The example below gives a useful example to work to</p>
    <pre>
     &lt;background&gt;0&lt;/background&gt;
     &lt;logpath&gt;/var/log/ices&lt;/logpath&gt;
     &lt;logfile&gt;ices.log&lt;/logfile&gt;
     &lt;logsize&gt;2048&lt;/logsize&gt;
     &lt;loglevel&gt;3&lt;/loglevel&gt;
     &lt;consolelog&gt;0&lt;/consolelog&gt;
     &lt;pidfile&gt;/var/log/ices/ices.pid&lt;/pidfile&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4>background</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     Set to 1 if you want IceS to put itself into the background.
    </div>
    <h4>logpath</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A directory that can be written to by the user that IceS runs as.  This
     can be anywhere you want but as log files are created, write access to the
     stated must be given.
    </div>
    <h4>logfile</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     The name of the logfile created. On log re-opening the existing logfile is
     renamed to &lt;logfile&gt;.1
    </div>
    <h4>logsize</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     When the log file reaches this size (in kilobytes) then the log file will
     be cycled (the default is 2Meg)
    </div>
    <h4>loglevel</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A number that represents the amount of logging performed.
     <ul>
      <li>1 - Only error messages are logged
      <li>2 - The above and warning messages are logged
      <li>3 - The above and information messages are logged
      <li>4 - The above and debug messages are logged
     </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>consolelog</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     A value of 1 will cause the log messages to appear on the console instead
     of the log files. Setting this to 1 is generally discouraged as logs are
     cycled and writing to screen can cause stalls in the application, which
     is a problem for timing critical applications.
    </div>
    <h4>pidfile</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     State a filename with path to be created at start time. This file will
     then contain a single number which represents the process id of the
     running IceS. This process id can then be used to signal the application
     of certain events.
    </div>
    <h2>Stream section</h2>
    <p>This describes how the input and outgoing streams are configured.<p>
    <pre>
     &lt;stream&gt;
         Metadata
         Input
         Instance
     &lt;/stream&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <pre>
     &lt;metadata&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;My Stream&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;genre&gt;Rock&lt;/genre&gt;
         &lt;description&gt;A short description of your stream&lt;/description&gt;
         &lt;url&gt;http://mysite.org&lt;/url&gt;
     &lt;/metadata&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
     This section describes what metadata information is passed in the headers
     at connection time to icecast.  This applies to each instance defined within
     the stream section but maybe overridden by a per-instance &lt;metadata&gt;
     section.
    </p>
    <h3>Input</h3>
    <p>
     This section deals with getting the audio data into IceS. There are a few
     ways that can happen. Typically it's either from a playlist or via a soundcard.
    </p>
    <p>
     The layout is consistent between the different input modules. Within the
     input section a module tag is needed to identify the module in question. The
     rest are made up of param tags specific to the module. There can be several
     param tags supplied to a module.  Details of the module parameters are
     shown later.
    </p>
    <h3>Instance</h3>
    <p>
     Multiple instances can be defined to allow for multiple encodings, this
     is useful for encoding the same input to multiple bitrates. Each instance
     defines a particular set actions that occur on the passed in audio. Any
     modifications to the input data is isolated to the instance.
    </p>
    <pre>
     &lt;instance&gt;
        hostname
        port
        password
        mount
        yp
        resample
        downmix
        savefile
        encode
     &lt;/instance&gt;
    </pre>
    <h4>hostname</h4>
    <div class=indentedbox>
     State the hostname of the icecast to contact, this can be a name or IP
     address and can be IPv4 or IPv6 on systems that support IPv6. The default
     is localhost.
   </div>
   <h4>port</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State the port to connect to, this will be the port icecast is listening on,
    typically 8000 but can be any.
   </div>
   <h4>password</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    For providing a stream, a username/password has to be provided, and must
    match what icecast expects.
   </div>
   <h4>mount</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Mountpoints are used to identify a particular stream on a icecast server,
    they must begin with / and for the sake of certain listening clients should
    end with the .ogg extension.
   </div>
   <h4>yp</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    By default streams will not be advertised on a YP server unless this is set,
    and only then if the icecast if configured to talk to YP servers.
   </div>
   <h4>reconnectdelay</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If the connection to the server is lost ices2 will wait a given time before reconnecting.
    This setting controls how long ices2 will wait before reconnecting.
    The value is the time in seconds.
   </div>
   <h4>reconnectattempts</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    This setting controls the number of reconnet attempts ices2 will do before considering
    the server to be down and stopping the instance.
   </div>
   <h4>retry-initial</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    This setting controls if being unabled to connect to the server at startup is considered a fatal error.
    The default is to consider this a fatal error and quit making debugging more easy.
   </div>
   <h4>Resample</h4>
   <pre>
    &lt;resample&gt;
        &lt;in-rate&gt;44100&lt;/in-rate&gt;
        &lt;out-rate&gt;22050&lt;/out-rate&gt;
    &lt;/resample&gt;
   </pre>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     When encoding or re-encoding, there is a point where you take PCM audio
     and encode to Ogg Vorbis. In some situations a particular encoded stream may
     require a lower samplerate to achieve a lower bitrate. The resample will
     modify the audio data before it enters the encoder, but does not affect
     other instances.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most common values used are 48000, 44100, 22050 and 11025, and is
     really only used to resample to a lower samplerate, going to a higher rate
     serves no purpose within IceS.
    </p>
   </div>
   <h4>Downmix</h4>
   <pre>
    &lt;downmix&gt;1&lt;/downmix&gt;
   </pre>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Some streams want to reduce the bitrate further, reducing the number of channels
    used to just 1. Converting stereo to mono is fairly common and when this is set
    to 1 the number of channels encoded is just 1. Like resample, this only affects
    the one instance it's enabled in.
   </div>
   <h4>Savefile</h4>
   <pre>
    &lt;savefile&gt;/home/ices/dump/stream1.ogg&lt;/savefile&gt;
   </pre>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Sometimes the stream transmitted wants to be saved to disk. This can be useful
    for live recordings.
   </div>
   <h4>encode</h4>
   <pre>
    &lt;encode&gt;  
        &lt;quality&gt;0&lt;/quality&gt;
        &lt;nominal-bitrate&gt;65536&lt;/nominal-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;maximum-bitrate&gt;131072&lt;/maximum-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;minimum-bitrate&gt;-1&lt;/minimum-bitrate&gt;
        &lt;managed&gt;0&lt;/managed&gt;
        &lt;samplerate&gt;22050&lt;/samplerate&gt;
        &lt;channels&gt;1&lt;/channels&gt;
        &lt;flush-samples&gt;11000&lt;/flush-samples&gt;
    &lt;/encode&gt;
   </pre>
   <p>
    Remove this section if you don't want your files reencoded when
    using playback or RoarAudio input module.
   </p>

   <p>quality</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a quality measure for the encoder. The range goes from -1 to 10 where -1
    is the lowest bitrate selection (default 3), and decimals can also be stated, so
    for example 1.5 is valid.  The actual bitrate used will depend on the tuning in
    the vorbis libs, the samplerate, channels and the audio to encode. A quality of 0
    at 44100hz and 2 channels is typically around the 64kbps mark.
   </div>
   <p>nominal-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State a bitrate that the encoder should try to keep to. This can be used as an
    alternative to selecting quality. 
   </div>
   <p>managed</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State 1 to enable full bitrate management in the encoder. This is used with
    nominal-bitrate, maximum-bitrate and minimum-bitrate to produce a stream with
    more strict bitrate requirements. Enabling this currently leads to higher CPU
    usage.
   </div>
   <p>maximum-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State bitrate in bits per second to limit max bandwidth used on a stream. Only
    applies if managed is enabled.
   </div>
   <p>minimum-bitrate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State bitrate in bits per second to limit minimum bandwidth used on a stream.
    Only applies if managed is enabled, this option has very little use so
    should not really be needed.
   </div>
   <p>samplerate</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State the samplerate used for the encoding, this should be either the same as
    the input or the result of the resample. Getting the samplerate wrong will
    cause the audio to be represented wrong and therefore sound like it's running
    too fast or too slow.
   </div>
   <p>channels</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    State the number of channels to use in the encoding. This will either be the
    number of channels from the input or 1 if downmix is enabled.
   </div>
   <p>flush-samples</p>
   <div class=indentedbox>
     This is the trigger level at which Ogg pages are created for sending to the server.
     Depending on the bitrate and compression achieved a single Ogg page can contain many
     seconds of audio which may not be wanted as that can trigger timeouts.
     <p>Setting this to the same value as the encode samplerate will mean that a page per
     second is sent, if a value that is half of the encoded samplerate is specified then
     2 Ogg pages per second are sent.</p>
