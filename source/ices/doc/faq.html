   <p>
    This for those questions people have asked as it wasn't covered
    in the documentation
   </p>
   <h4>Can ices play mp3 files</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
    No, there hasn't been much interest in handling MP3 with ices 2. The older version ices
    0.x maybe of interest in such cases.  If you really want to encode the Vorbis stream from
    non-vorbis files then you can play them with an external application, eg xmms, and use
    ices 2 to capture from the soundcard, but be aware that any conversion from one lossy format
    to another is bad so make sure the original material is high quality.
    </p>
   </div>
   <h4>How do I encode from Line-In</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     IceS will read from the DSP on the soundcard, but where that gets the
     audio from depends on the mixer settings.  Use a utility like aumix/alsamixer to 
     see the settings and change the capture or recording device. Usually the
     default is the Mic
    <p>
   </div>
   <h4>When I start ices 2 it seems to get stuck not doing anything</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If you are using live input, check to see if something else is holding the
    recording device (typically /dev/dsp) open. A good candidate is esd. What
    happens is that the driver only allows one application to have the device
    open at any one time, a second attempt will just block.
    <p>Some OSS drivers allow multiple opens but on ALSA you can configure a virtual
    device in asound.conf, type dsnoop/dmix, which allows access for multiple apps.</p>
   </div>
   <h4>Ices reports a message about failing to set samplerate on live input</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Some hardware/drivers are limited in the settings they support. Sometimes
    they only support one samplerate like 48khz. You have to experiment if the
    documentation for the device is not specific.
   </div>
   <h4>Can I do crossfading with the playlist</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    Ices does not do much in the way manipulating the audio itself, resampling
    and downmixing are available as that has a direct effect on encoding an
    outgoing stream.  Ices can still be used in conjunction with other
    applications such as xmms by making ices read from the say the dsp (eg
    oss, alsa etc), that way anything that is played by that other application
    is encoded and sent to icecast.
   </div>
   <h4>My player connects but I don't hear anything</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
     If you are getting data through to the player and the settings show like the
     samplerate and chnnels then it is probably the mixer settings which are set
     incorrectly and ices can only read silence. A common example, ALSA may have
     many levels in the mixer and by default they are all muted.
   </div>
   <h4>My player seems unable to play the stream</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    If the stream looks to be getting to the player then it will be how the
    player is handling it. The usual causes of this are
    <ul>missing ".ogg"  extension. Both ices and icecast do not care about the
    extension however some apps use the extension to determine which plugin to
    use.</ul>
    <ul>Missing Ogg Vorbis plugin. The winamp lite versions were known for
    this.</ul>
    <ul>Are you running Winamp 3. This is a discontinued product and had problems
    with the vorbis plugin, either use the later v2.9 series or v5.</ul>
   </div>
   <h4>The sound quality is poor</h4>
   <div class=indentedbox>
    <p>
     Ogg Vorbis is a lossy compression technology, so quality of the sound is
     reduced, however with live input the source of audio can be poor depending
     on the soundcard and the system it's in.  As an initial test just record
     a wav file from the DSP (using eg rec, arecord etc) and listen to the
     quality of the audio recorded.  If the source of audio is poor then encoding
     it to Ogg Vorbis is not going to improve it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reasons for poor audio from the DSP can be difficult to resolve, search
     for information on audio quality.  It could be driver related or maybe some
     interference from some other device.
